* Persist the dinosaur data using 'window.localStorage'.
The Dinosaurs shoulds stay in the list even when the page is refreshed. 

## Day 4 Homework

* Fix the issue with dino id values, which sometimes results in removing the wrong dinosaur from the array (and thus from `localStorage`).

### Bonus Credit

* Add another field to the form, and make sure that data (such as eating habits, era in which it lived, etc.) also persists across page loads.
* Make it look nice.

### Super Mega Bonus Credit

* Edit the names of dinosaurs that are already in the list (and make sure the changes persist across page loads). Gee, it would nice if we could make that span's _content editable_ somehow.
